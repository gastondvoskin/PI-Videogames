--- git commit -m "Implemented Card.jsx and Detail.jsx using a hardcoded videogame object. Implemented Card.module.css and Detail.module.css."

Next steps: 
replace Nav for NavLink in Card component. 
implement Detail view with the same harcoded Object. 
map a hardcoded array of two elements in Cards to pass data to Card component. 


- view Home. components Cards, Card. 

- Card: render a hardcoded object. 
- Cards: map a hardcoded array. implement redus. replace hardcoded array. (only display 3 results). Don't implement filters neither pagination nor searchbar. 

- view Detail. render a hardcoded object. create a dinamic route with the hook Navigate. replace the hardcoded object with axios (not with redux). 


- Filters, sortings, SearchBar, Pagination: don't implement yet. 
- view Form. Don't implement yet.
