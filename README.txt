My name is Gast√≥n Dvoskin, and I am a full-stack web developer. This project was created in 2023 as part of my studies at Soy Henry Accademy.
This webpage renders videogames from my database and from rawg API. The functionalities of the webpage allows the user to search by name, to filter by creator and by genre, to sort the results alphabetically and by rating, to combine the filters and to view more information about the videogame. The user also has access to an admin view in which it is possible to create a new videogame that will be saved in my database and it will be able to be accessed, filtered and sorted like all the other videogames. 
The main tecnologies used for this project were: Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJS, Express and Sequelize. 
Thank you for visiting my webpage. If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback, please feel free to contact me via https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaston-dvoskin/
